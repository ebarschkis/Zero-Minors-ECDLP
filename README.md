NOTE:
I personally believe for the Initial Minors Conjecture (Conjecture A) to be both false in its strong and weak form. 
However this does not rule out that the zero minor approach might not be of note for future research. 
It does potentially offer a clue towards something that looks like a non-generic potentially polynomial-time or at worst sub-exponential-time algorithm to solving the ECDLP.
There is a lot more research to be done here and I personally think that this rabbit hole goes way deeper...

I definitely think that the Conjecture needs to be defined in a less vague manner and requires a lot more attention if we want it to go anywhere.
